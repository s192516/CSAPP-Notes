# Memory

- Storage technologies

  1. RAMs
     - Volatile: SRAM & DRAM (caches & main memories)
     - Nonvolatile: ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM (firmware, ssd & disk caches)
  2. Rotating disks
  3. SSDs
     - Page can be written only after its block has been erased

- Locality

  - Temporal locality
  - Spatial locality

- Hierarchy

- Caches

  - Each level in hierarchy serves as cache for the level below
  - Types of cache misses
    1. Cold miss: "Warm up" cache
    2. Capacity miss: Working set larger than cache size
    3. Conflict miss: Limited by positioning restrictions imposed by hardware
  - Examples of cache

    1. Direct mapped cache has (E / associativity = 1)

    2. E-way set associative cache (Here E / associativity = 2)

  - Metrics

    1. Miss rate
    2. Hit time
    3. Miss penalty

  - Write cache-friendly code

    1. Make the common cases go first
    2. Minimize the misses in inner loops
    3. Try to maximize spatial locality by reading objects sequentially with stride 1
    4. Try to maximize temporal locality by using an object as often as possible once it's read from memory

  - Example of matrix multiplication

    - In which order to arrange the loops? Do miss rate analysis!
    - It turns out: kij/ikj > ijk/jik > jki/kji
    - Use blocking: multiplying by sub-matrices
